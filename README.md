## Motivation

Hacker News is one of the most visited news and discussion sites in the startup and tech industry.
However, the site lacks the look and features you would expect from a modern website.
HNselect brings social feautures to HN through a Chrome Extension that contextualizes the site's content.

## Features
HNselect will highlight stories and comments that are contribited by people you chose to follow.


## Installation
Download the Chrome Extension at [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hnselect/jbbidiepnmelekfimfibcihoijpbibpa)
